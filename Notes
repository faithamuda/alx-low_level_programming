Recursion.
When solving a problem recursively the first thing to do
is to find the base case
If not the code becomes an infinite loop and eventually crashes due to 
Stack overload
The base case is like the endpoint of your commamd
the recursive case

while loop
in while loop we initialize a variable only when we are using the while loop (in which the variable will be used) just after (initializing) it.

argc and argv
In c a char* means a string
so char* argv[] is an array of strings
argc is argument count..
   it is the number of things that we entered into the command prompt
     when running our house executable
